# PyBCN site
## Local environment setup

In order to edit the site, you should have it setup appropriately.
This can be achieved by running the `bin/install` script from within
the directory where the site's repository was cloned.

This script will install the extended version of Hugo binary, if it is
not already present in the system.  It will also get and install the
Hugo theme for PyBCN site.
